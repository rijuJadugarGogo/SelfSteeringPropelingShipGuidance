# SelfSteeringPropelingShipGuidance
A brief model to steer and propel a ship through obstacles and bad climatic condition.
This model uses road segmentation,object detection to identify other ships and the sea to layout a route free of obstacles, it also uses a weather guiding system which takes input from the sattelite as red zones, orange zones and green zones to avoid zones and vary the speed and steering angle.
